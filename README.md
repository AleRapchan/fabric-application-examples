# Fabric Application Examples	

A test and demo repository showing how the programming model works; best practices and suggested approaches. Along with useful tools for developing with Fabric - all based out of tools I've created when working at IBM as Hyperledger Fabric maintainer.

## IBP v2.0

Hyperledger Fabric is at the heart of [IBM Blockchain Platform v2.0](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/blockchain-platform-20)

## Repository structure

- docs
  - Documentation - in markdown format
- application
  - examples of client applications showing how the programming model works
- contracts
  - javascript and typescript contracts
- infrastructure
  - the configuration to bring up the fabric infrastructure required.
- tools
  - additional CLI tools for development

The intent is to add matching/equivalent contracts and applications in the other languages (Golang, Java, Typescript .net)
