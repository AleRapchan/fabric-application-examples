# Fabric Application Examples	

A test and demo repo showing how the programming model works. Code is AS-IS, and may change.

This code will be folded into the Hyperledger Fabric docs at some point.

[Introduction to 1.4 contract programming model](./docs/Into-to-1.4-contract-programming.md)

[Setting up Fabric locally for development](./docs/setting-up-a-local-dev-fabric-infrastructure.md)

[Running the Commercial Paper Contract and Application](./docs/Running-Commercial-Paper-Contract.md)

## Repository structure

- docs
  - Documentation - in markdown format
- application
  - examples of client applications showing how the programming model works
- contracts
  - javascript and typescript contracts
- infrastructure
  - the configuration to bring up the fabric infrastructure required.

The hope would be to add matching/equivalent contracts and applications in the other languages (Golang, Java, Typescript .net)
